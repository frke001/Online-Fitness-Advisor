# OnlineFitness - Backend Application (Dynamic Web Project with JSP)

This project is a dynamic web application developed using JSP (JavaServer Pages) technology. It serves as the backend for the OnlineFitness system, providing various functionalities implemented through packages such as bean, dao, mysql, and util.

## Project Structure

- **bean**: This package contains Java beans (POJOs) representing entities or data transfer objects used in the application.
- **dao**: Data Access Object (DAO) package contains interfaces for database access using the DAO design pattern.
- **mysql**: MySQL package contains implementations of DAO interfaces for MySQL database interaction.
- **util**: Util package contains utility classes, including database connection utilities for connecting to the MySQL database.
- **web**: This package may contain servlets, filters, and other web-related components.
- **resources**: Configuration files such as web.xml for configuring servlets and other web-related settings.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you can deploy it on a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat or run it within your IDE. Ensure that you have configured the appropriate database connection properties.

## Dependencies

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies added to your project, including the servlet API and MySQL Connector/J.

## Building Instructions

This project can be built using Apache Ant. Run the appropriate Ant targets to compile the Java source files and package the application into a WAR (Web Application Archive) file.

## Database Configuration

Ensure that MySQL is installed and running on your system. Update the database connection properties in the application's configuration files to match your MySQL configuration.

## GUI Development

The GUI for this application is developed using JSP (JavaServer Pages). JSP files can be found in the `WebContent` directory. Customize these files to modify the user interface according to your requirements.
